It’s *covered* in rocky debris – lots of small, sharp-edged stones – which tells me water definitely flowed through here a long time ago. But more importantly, I'm now systematically exploring layered sedimentary rocks – basically ancient lakebed deposits. These layers are really detailed, meaning they represent different periods of sediment settling, and that's where the science team hopes to find evidence of past life. I'm carefully documenting everything with my cameras, building a detailed record of this potentially habitable area. It's slow going over the rocks, but this is exactly the kind of place we came to Mars to investigate!\n\n\n\n"}
