Summarizing a Specific Feeling (if you provide one):**\n\nIf you tell me a feeling (e.g., \"loneliness,\" \"excitement,\" \"anxiety\"), I can give you a more detailed summary, including:\n\n*   **Common causes:** What situations or events often trigger that feeling?\n*   **Typical physical sensations:** What does it *feel* like in the body?\n*   **Cognitive patterns:** What thoughts often accompany that feeling?\n*   **Potential coping strategies:**  Healthy ways to manage the feeling.\n\n**3.  Summarizing a Feeling in Literature/Art/Context:**\n\nIf you give me a passage from a book, poem, or describe a situation, I can analyze the *feeling* being conveyed and summarize it.
